# sunvox
Multi-platform (PalmOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows, OSX, Meegoâ€¦) modular synthesizer and music tracker

This repository is a mirror of SunVox 1.3b sources provided
by original developer NightRadio under a BSD license:
http://sunvox.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/all-sunvox-versions-from-2008.html

This included only the SunDog engine (multi-platform toolkit for building apps)
and the SunVox engine (the synthesizer), but NOT the SunVox UI and app itself.

This means you can use this to build apps playing or producing SunVox
files using the same UI toolkit, but you won't be able to just build
the exact same SunVox application.

Versions 1.4 and later are closed-source.
You can download them from: http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/

Feel free to use this source code to make an open source fork of SunVox 
or use the SunVox engine in your project/video game/etc. :)
